            <p>Web development is the process of creating websites and web applications. It is a broad
                term involving various technologies, including web design, web content management,
                web scripting, web server, and web browser. We can also refer to the web development
                process as the development of a website.This document contains a list of the most
                common web development technologies and tools.
            </p>
            <h3 id="html">HTML</h3>
            <p> Markup language that defines the structure and layout of web pages.Total of 5 versions: HTML1, HTML2, HTML3.2, HTML4.01, HTML5
                Consists of elements made of its content and the opening and closing tags (with some exceptions).Markup language that defines the 
                structure and layout of web pages. The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to
                be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as
                JavaScript.  Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
                HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
                HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded 
                into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, 
                paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. 
                Tags such as *img tag* and *input tag* directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as *p tag* surround and provide information 
                about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content
                of the page.
                    
            </>
            <h3 id="css">CSS</h3>
            <p>CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so you can give a far better look to your HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes.
               Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web 
               pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the
               HTML that makes up each web page. It describes how a webpage should look: it prescribes colors, fonts, spacing, and much more. In short,
               you can make your website look however you want. CSS lets developers and designers define how it behaves, including how elements are
               positioned in the browser. while html uses tags, css uses rulesets. CSS is easy to learn and understand, but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document</p>
            <h3 id="ws">WebStorage</h3>
            <p>
                <h4>Session Storage</h4>
                <p>Stores data for a particular “session”. If the tab or window is closed, the data is cleared.
                    Storage size limit is almost 5MB</p>
            
                <h4>Local Storage</h4>
                <p>Stores data for a locally. This doesn't expire 
                    unless cleared using JavaScript or clearing cache of the browser/tab.
                    Storage size limit is almost 5MB Stores data for a locally. This doesn't expire

            <h3 id="cw">Canvas and WebGL</h3>
            <p>Used for animations, data visualization (charts, graphs, etc.), photo manipulation among other things.
                Canvas API in itself is limited to 2D graphics.
                WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is a JavaScript API used to create high performance, interactive 2D and 3D graphics without any plug-ins.
                Has the capability to use hardware graphics acceleration provided by the user's device.
                Utilizes the 'canvas' element to render the graphics.Used for animations, data visualization (charts, graphs, etc.), photo manipulation among other things.
                WebGL is the version of OpenGL, which is a 3D engine. It helps its user to perform 3D manipulation in web browsers. Canvas is a 
                part of HTML5, allows its users with dynamic, script rendered 2D shapes. It can be considered a low level that has the ability to 
                update bitmap images and does not have a built-in scene graph. These are used in the games (2D and 3D) with abstraction layers 
                such as PIXI.js and several others like Three.JS and Unity.
